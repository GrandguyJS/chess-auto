# chess-auto
I was just bored one weekend, so I did this. Just run main.py with python and go to localhost:5000. Input a FEN and the board will load. Then you can input the move you want to do which will update the board accordingly. Inputing a move requires to specify both squares, for example e2e4 instead of e4. Castling for white with O-O and O-O-O, for black with o-o and o-o-o. Note that this app doesn't have any logic, it only has the interface of a chess.com chess board, so you can do illegal moves or anything really. The point of the website is, that after you played a few moves, you can click on submit, and it will create a short video of all the moves (2 sec per move). As I already said, this was just a little project which I probably won't work on more, so I am sorry, for the not existing CSS.
